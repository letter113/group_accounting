After our group trip, I found it a little headache to track we paid money for whom and 
who owns whom money and how in summary the money transition should go. So a script to
do that, I thought.

Input will be a file:

3 # number of person
1:Alice
2:Bob
3:Cat 
1 90: 1,2,3 # means Alice paid 90 for them 3 and they should equally share it
2 80: 1 50, 3 10 # means Bob paid 80, of which Alice should pay 50, Cat pay 10

Results:
Alice should pay Bob 20
Cat should pay Alice 30, Bob 10
